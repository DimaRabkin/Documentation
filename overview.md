Upsolver is a streaming aggregation engine for [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).  
It [continuously queries](/continuous-queries.md) streams, incrementally stores the results in any [output](/outputs.md). Query results are always up-to-date as they change with every new event.

Upsolver [empowers data scientists, analysts and developers](/who-should-use.md) to query streams, without ETL code, scripts and data plumbing. Upsolver allows doing everything enabled by a database, but for streams, including [multi-value aggregations](/aggregations/multi-value-aggregations.md), [long time-window aggregations](/aggregations/sliding-time-windows.md), retroactive queries from S3 and [joining streams](/calculated-fields/index-lookup.md).
