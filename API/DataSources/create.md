## Amazon S3

Connect to your AWS S3 Bucket. Files should be partitioned by date and time.

Upsolver can read events directly from your cloud storage, assuming events are partitioned by event date and time (defines the folder structure in the cloud storage).
A prerequisite for defining a cloud storage data source is providing Upsolver with the appropriate credentials for reading from your cloud storage. If you haven't done this yet, please refer to this page.
