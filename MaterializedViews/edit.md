# Edit Materialized View

[Materialized Views](/MaterializedViews/README.md) are immutable after they are deployed. This ensures your data will remain correct throughout the entire history and will prevent unexpected results for queries. However, you can still edit a materialized view by cloning it. 

## How To Clone And Edit A Materialized View
1. From the drop-down menu next to the _Run/Stop_ button click _Duplicate_.
2. Name your duplicate view and click _Duplicate_ to confirm.
3. You can now edit your materialized view in the same manner you did when [creating it](/MaterializedViews/create.md).
